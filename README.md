# mv-data

This code first sets the parameters for the number of samples, clusters, views, and dimensions. It then generates random cluster centers for each view and uses these centers to generate data for each view. The data is generated by randomly assigning each sample to one of the two clusters and then adding some random noise to the cluster centers. Finally, the code plots the data for each view.
